all signals are initially red


when do we toggle it green?
    when there is a car(s) in that intersection  i1

    at t= tx  how do we find how many cars in intersection i1
        -> depends on the incoming streets
            -> length of the path
            -> green /red at prior intersection

when should we toggle a signal red?
